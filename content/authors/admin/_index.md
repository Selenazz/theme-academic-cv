## About Me

I am currently a second-year Master Student at David R. Cheriton School of Computer Science, University of Waterloo, under the supervision of Dr. Jian Zhao. Previously I completed my Bachelor of Science degree in Psychology at University of Toronto.

My current research focuses on AI-mediated communication, specifically and how the tone of AI writing tools affects how people perceive social situations. More broadly, I am passionate about understanding how digital tools shape human interactions, particularly how it may either facilitate or hinder cross-cultural communication and understanding.
